# Smart_Parking
The Smart Parking System is a web based  solution that detects parking slot availability, allows users to  reserve slots, and enables authorities to manage parking spaces efficiently.  The system integrates a web application and digital payment mechanisms to provide a seamless experience. This reduces congestion and  optimizes space utilization. 
 Background 
In urban areas, drivers often spend 10–30 minutes searching for parking, 
resulting in fuel wastage, stress, and traffic congestion. Traditional parking 
systems lack automation and real-time monitoring. A smart, automated system 
can solve these issues efficiently. 
1.2 Objectives 
• To provide real-time parking slot availability. 
• To allow users to search and book parking slots online. 
• To reduce time, fuel consumption, and congestion. 
• To provide administrators with a dashboard to monitor parking 
operations. 
1.3 Motivation & Relevance 
With increasing vehicle densities, cities need intelligent parking management to 
improve transport efficiency and urban mobility. This project aligns with 
Smart City initiatives and sustainable mobility goals. 
2. Problem Definition 
Cities lack a mechanism to effectively manage parking spaces in real time. 
Users are unaware of availability, leading to congestion and frustration. Parking 
lot authorities also struggle with manual monitoring. 
Novelty 
• Integrates real-time IoT sensor data with web reservation. 
• Dynamic updates and notifications improve user decision-making. 
• Provides centralized monitoring dashboard. 
Scope 
• Applicable to malls, campuses, public parking lots, tech parks, 
apartments. 
• Supports multi-lot management and digital payments. 
Limitations 
• Requires internet connectivity for real-time updates. 
• Hardware sensor accuracy depends on environment conditions.
